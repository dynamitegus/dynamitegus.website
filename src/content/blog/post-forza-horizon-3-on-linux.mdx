export const PageColour = "text-peach"
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import ShortLinksHover from '/src/components/ShortLinksHover.astro';
import { Code } from 'astro-expressive-code/components'

after downloading the file a week ago and then extracting it i pull the basic 
```shell frame="terminal" showLineNumbers collapse={2-14, 29-64} wrap {16, 18-19, 27, 29, 31-32, 40, 42, 44-45, 53} 
wine Setup_FH3.exe
```
i get into the provided script that the script gave me and get these errors
```shell frame="terminal" showLineNumbers collapse={2-14, 29-64} wrap {16, 18-19, 27, 29, 31-32, 40, 42, 44-45, 53}

0150:fixme:powershell:wmain argv[1] L"Add-AppxPackage"                                                                                                  
0150:fixme:powershell:wmain argv[2] L"'C:\\users\\angus\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\9bcd.tmp\\9bce.tmp\\AppxManifest.xml'"                                   
0150:fixme:powershell:wmain argv[3] L"-Register"
```

## so off to lutris i go:
running the intstaller just spamed the output so i think i will just run it in powershell as this was made for windows
or atleast i will install it in wine
this appears to have install powershell
so now we run the script again

ahhh i should have read the readme 9i need to run installer.bat or whatever its called
