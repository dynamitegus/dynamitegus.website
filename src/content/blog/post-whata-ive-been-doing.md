# Heyyyyyy
This is my first reall post that isnt just one from the tutorial. WOOOOO

Im still working out how to ge tthe sorting right on the blog page and i should probably merge this branch back in with the master branch but its fineee for now.

## what i have actually done.
i started off with the astro tutorial and progressed from there, i had a colour scheme that i changed too between the tutorial and the current catpuccin one so you might see some remenents from that here and there, mainly though i have been working on the colour scheme and getting it too look real nice. 
## where i am going
im going to continue trying to fix the sorting on the blog page and i need to properly do the colours for the blog posts i think. The sorting code for the blog page i sourced from [petermorgan.dev](https://petermorgan.dev/) which has been really helpful. i also need to hyperlink that properly...
