So I'm sitting in a maths lecture a bit bored as I was finding the topics covered a little to easy and my mind goes back to [a page](https://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/contact) I saw when I was applying to be a volunteer at the Country Fire Authority in Victoria.

While looking at the "Find Your Nearest CFA Brigade" map, the map above it caught my eye.
<Image alt="A map of Victoria with regions marked with CFA district names" src={cfadistrictmap} class="rounded-xl m-4" />
While having a look at the map(i wanted to see if the few CFA brigades outside victoria were on there) I realised that a few districts just straight up didnt exist, namely District 01. Just quickly, here are the districts that exist in order.


- District 02 in the <span class="text-yellow">North West region</span>
- District 04 in the <span class="text-mauve">South West  region</span>
- District 05 in the <span class="text-mauve">South West  region</span>
- District 06 in the <span class="text-mauve">South West  region</span>
- District 07 in the <span class="text-mauve">South West  region</span>
- District 08 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>
- District 09 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>
- District 10 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>
- District 11 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>
- District 12 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 13 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 14 in the <span class="text-yellow">North West region</span>
- District 15 in the <span class="text-sky">West          region</span>
- District 16 in the <span class="text-sky">West          region</span>
- District 17 in the <span class="text-sky">West          region</span>
- District 18 in the <span class="text-yellow">North West region</span>
- District 20 in the <span class="text-yellow">North West region</span>
- District 22 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 23 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 24 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 27 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>

So, upon making this list i realise that there are less missing than I thought, but there are still some missing, namely:

- District 01
- District 03
- District 19
- District 21
- District 25
- District 26
