So Im sitting in a maths lecture a bit bored as I was finding the topics covered a little to easy and my mind goes back to [a page](https://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/contact) I saw when I was applying to be a volunteer at the Country Fire Authority in Victoria.

While looking at the "Find Your Nearest CFA Brigade" map, the map above it caught my eye.
<Image alt="A map of Victoria with regions marked with CFA district names" src={cfadistrictmap} class="rounded-xl m-4" />
While having a look at the map(i wanted to see if the few CFA brigades outside victoria were on there) I realised that a few districts just straight up didnt exist, namely District 01. Just quickly, here are the districts that exist in order.


- District 02 in the <span class="text-yellow">North West region</span>
- District 04 in the <span class="text-mauve">South West  region</span>
- District 05 in the <span class="text-mauve">South West  region</span>
- District 06 in the <span class="text-mauve">South West  region</span>
- District 07 in the <span class="text-mauve">South West  region</span>
- District 08 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>
- District 09 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>
- District 10 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>
- District 11 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>
- District 12 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 13 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 14 in the <span class="text-yellow">North West region</span>
- District 15 in the <span class="text-sky">West          region</span>
- District 16 in the <span class="text-sky">West          region</span>
- District 17 in the <span class="text-sky">West          region</span>
- District 18 in the <span class="text-yellow">North West region</span>
- District 20 in the <span class="text-yellow">North West region</span>
- District 22 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 23 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 24 in the <span class="text-red">North East    region</span>
- District 27 in the <span class="text-peach">South East  region</span>

So, upon making this list i realise that there are less missing than I thought, but there are still some missing, namely:

- District 01
- District 03
- District 19
- District 21
- District 25
- District 26

## Hypothesis
Before I actually get to looking, if we have a look at the map we can see that most of the Districts numbered 20 and above appear to have been split off from surronding districts, in my opinion the most obvious example of this is District 27. I have a feeling that this happened with 23, 24 and 25.
## And so begins the lookening
I started by looking at older verisons of the cfa website and i found that the oldest version of this page is from 2012, which is far back enough to prove parts of my theory correct. [This page](https://web.archive.org/web/20121127203225/http://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/contact/) also has a map of the districts and here it is:

As you can see in this image my theory was correct, it appears that District 27 was split off from District 10, but this doesnt actually explain the weird numbering scheme, so my next idea was to go to the CFA home page and then find an older district map, The Internet Archive has archived versions of the page from 1998 but they are totally broken, odd but yk its fine probably, I mean who would be digging through old versions of their website...

anyway...

Look at this amazing webpage, I could show the non broken version but i think this is too funny, anyway pressing on the "Enter" button takes us to the actual page:

Looking through the working links here I found a very interesting PDF that was the 1999-2000 annual report, but unfortunatly it wasnt helpful.
