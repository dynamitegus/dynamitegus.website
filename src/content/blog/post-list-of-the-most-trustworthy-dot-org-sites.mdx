I actually cannot believe what I heard my **uni** tutor said earlier. 
He was talking about how and where to cite sources, which is important, but where it fell off the rails was when he started talking specificly about the gTLD that the domain name had.
He began talking about how .com then is probably trying to sell you something, which isnt entirely true, but its a fair thing to say. then he went onto talk about .org and I think .asn\(which as far as I am aware doesn\'t exist but alright\)
