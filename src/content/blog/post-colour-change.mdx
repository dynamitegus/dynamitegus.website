So back when I first made a decent [website](https://github.com/dynamitegus/dynamitegus.github.io) I used a very distinct theme, a black background with a magenta accent colour. I was pretty happy with this and it was quite similar to my profile picture and logo at the time, while using a very ascii and text based design as the whole thing was just HTML and CSS on github pages. Since then I progressed to Bootstrap and then to Astro with Tailwind and uh, just tailwind i think. Anyway, during my move to Tailwind I decided to re-theme around Catppuccin. This is a theme that I love and personally use everywhere that I can. So onto the website it went.
I designed this website at my grandparents holiday house in Tasmania, I remember showing it to my girlfriend and she said something along the lines of \"it just doesnt really feel like you anymore.\" I was pretty stoked with my website at the time but the more i have thought about it the more i have realised that it just doesnt fit. My homepage is a mess of colours and conflicting themes and I like my pfp to much to change that so I\'m changing the website instead.
# What am I actually changing??
Two things:
## 1. Colours
I am changing from Catppuccin Mocha and Latte to my custom dynight theme\(name open to change lol\).
here is what i am thinking:
<ColourBoxes />
\
These are just the colours from Catppuccin Latte as I really like them, but they will be modified as I use them alot of the colours are sticking around purely for backwards compatibility as I am too lazy to go through and look for all the uses of the old Catppuccin related code.
## 2. Style.
I was going to re-create my old website design, but have an intermediary design while I procrastinate the recreation, but as I have now created that intermediate design I think I will stick to this design for a while. Its a mashup of my last design and my first, that I think looks quite nice.
# Where too from here?
More blogposts, more yap, more projects, more typos.

I want to write a new blog post now but my laptop is on 10%, so I guess I wont \:\<
