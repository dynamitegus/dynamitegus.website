## Before we get started, I think we need to define some terms.

- A TLD or a **T*op **L**evel **D**omain is the little string of characters after the dot in the website address for example, google.com has a TLD of com
- TLDs come in various types including:
    - <ShortLinksHover LD="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#ICANN-era_generic_top-level_domains" LN="gTLD" PageColour={ PageColour } Title="List of gTLDs" Content="Wikipedia" />\(Generic TLD\) - say .com or .org
    - <ShortLinksHover LD="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Brand_and_corporate_top-level_domains" LN="sTLD" PageColour={ PageColour } Title="List of sTLDd" Content="Wikipedia" />\(Sponsered TLD\) - say .google or .apple
    - <ShortLinksHover LD="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain#Lists" LN="ccTLD" PageColour={ PageColour } Title="List of ccTLDs" Content="Wikipedia" />\(Country Code TLD\) - say .au or .gg, any two letter TLD is a  code that folows ISO 3166 
    - keep in mind this isnt all of them but these are the relevent ones. 
- A registrar is the company or organisation that interacts with the administrator of the TLD


I actually cannot believe what I heard my **uni** tutor said earlier. 
He was talking about how and where to cite sources, which is important, but then started talking about gTLDs.
His *education* on the topic began by talking about how .com is probably trying to sell you something, which isnt entirely true, but its a fair thing to say. Anyway, then he went onto talk about .org and I think .asn\(which as far as I am aware doesn\'t exist but alright\) 
\
\
\
then he said the thing:
> you can get you information from .org as they are trustworthy

\
ha\
haha\
ha ha ha\
\
no thats not how that works


## How domains actually work.

I have just recently done this, so its quite fresh in my mind.\
If you want to register a new domain name you need have:

- Access to a registrar
- A domain name to register
- Money to pay for the name
- The required information to register

there are a few exceptions to this
- If you are for example google, you dont need money to pay for the name because you are the registrar and probably created the TLD
- there are probably more that i cant think if right now.

I want to focus in on the last point on that requirements list, As this is what most people dont understand.
### The bit that people don\'t get.
When I want to register domain, I go to my registrar of choice\(Currently <ShortLinksHover LN="VentraIP" LD="https://ventraip.com.au/" PageColour={ PageColour } Title="VentraIP" Content="VentraIP is Australia's most trusted provider for domain names, website hosting, email hosting and online solutions. Get started online today"/>\) and then I search for my domain.
I then checkout with the domain, enter my personal details and then pay. Once thats done I have to wait for the domain to be registered with the administrator.\
Neat, I have a domain now im going to put website there and do a bunch of fun stuff.
But wait, if you go back to just after or just before you paid, you\'ll *probably* see something like "Identity Protection" this unsurprisingly protects your identity. But hangon, why do i need to do that?
### Enter: WHOIS
One of the main requirements that domain names had back in the 80\'s and 90\'s was displaying the details of the domain, this is called the WHOIS Protocol.
This data is public.\
Anyone can view this through <ShortLinksHover LN="who.is" LD="https://who.is/" PageColour={PageColour} Title="WHOIS Search, Domain Name, Website, and IP Tools - Who.is" Content="Find information on any domain name or website. Large database of whois information, RDAP, DNS, domain names, name servers, IPs, and tools for searching and monitoring domain names." /> or through the whois command on unix systems.
So I ran the whois command on my domain dynamitegus.org

<Code code="balls" lang="balls"/>

```bash frame="..." showLineNumbers
$ whois dynamitegus.org

I\'m not gonna make you dicipher that, but all you need to take not of is the constant REDACTED FOR PRIVACY. This is in this case, squarespace, redacting my name for privacy reasons, which you can do on .org. Me, dynamitegus has a .org, I\'m not a not for profit or a trustworthy organisation, hell the last version of this website had <span style="color:#ff00ff;">A totally trustworthy .org site</span> as the title on the landing page.
