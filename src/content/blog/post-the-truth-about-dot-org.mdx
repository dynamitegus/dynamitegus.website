## Before we get started, I think we need to define some terms.

- A TLD or a **T*op **L**evel **D**omain is the little string of characters after the dot in the website address for example, google.com has a TLD of com
- TLDs come in various types including:
    - <ShortLinksHover LD="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#ICANN-era_generic_top-level_domains" LN="gTLD" PageColour={ PageColour } Title="List of gTLDs" Content="Wikipedia" />\(Generic TLD\) - say .com or .org
    - <ShortLinksHover LD="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Brand_and_corporate_top-level_domains" LN="sTLD" PageColour={ PageColour } Title="List of sTLDd" Content="Wikipedia" />\(Sponsered TLD\) - say .google or .apple
    - <ShortLinksHover LD="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain#Lists" LN="ccTLD" PageColour={ PageColour } Title="List of ccTLDs" Content="Wikipedia" />\(Country Code TLD\) - say .au or .gg, any two letter TLD is a  code that folows ISO 3166 
    - keep in mind this isn\'t all of them but these are the relevent ones. 
- A registrar is the company or organisation that interacts with the administrator of the TLD


I actually cannot believe what I heard my **uni** tutor said earlier. 
He was talking about how and where to cite sources, which is important, but then started talking about gTLDs.
His *education* on the topic began by talking about how .com is probably trying to sell you something, which isn\'t entirely true, but it\'sa fair thing to say. Anyway, then he went onto talk about .org and I think .asn\(which as far as I am aware doesn\'t exist but alright\) 
\
\
\
then he said the thing:
> you can get you information from .org as they are trustworthy

\
ha\
haha\
ha ha ha\
\
no thats not how that works


## How domains actually work.

I have just recently done this, so it\'squite fresh in my mind.\
If you want to register a new domain name you need have:

- Access to a registrar
- A domain name to register
- Money to pay for the name
- The required information to register

there are a few exceptions to this
- If you are for example google, you dont need money to pay for the name because you are the registrar and probably created the TLD
- there are probably more that I cant think if right now.

I want to focus in on the last point on that requirements list, As this is what most people dont understand.
### The bit that people don\'t get.
When I want to register domain, I go to my registrar of choice\(Currently <ShortLinksHover LN="VentraIP" LD="https://ventraip.com.au/" PageColour={ PageColour } Title="VentraIP" Content="VentraIP is Australia's most trusted provider for domain names, website hosting, email hosting and online solutions. Get started online today"/>\) and then I search for my domain.
I then checkout with the domain, enter my personal details and then pay. Once thats done I have to wait for the domain to be registered with the administrator.\
Neat, I have a domain now I\'m going to put website there and do a bunch of fun stuff.
But wait, if you go back to just after or just before you paid, you\'ll *probably* see something like "Identity Protection" this unsurprisingly protects your identity. But hangon, why do I need to do that?
### Enter: WHOIS
One of the main requirements that domain names had back in the 80\'s and 90\'s was displaying the details of the domain, this is called the WHOIS Protocol.
This data is public.\
Anyone can view this through <ShortLinksHover LN="who.is" LD="https://who.is/" PageColour={PageColour} Title="WHOIS Search, Domain Name, Website, and IP Tools - Who.is" Content="Find information on any domain name or website. Large database of whois information, RDAP, DNS, domain names, name servers, IPs, and tools for searching and monitoring domain names." /> or through the whois command on unix systems.
So I ran the whois command on my domain dynamitegus.org.

```yaml frame="terminal" showLineNumbers collapse={2-14, 29-64} wrap {16, 18-19, 27, 29, 31-32, 40, 42, 44-45, 53}

I\'m not gonna make you dicipher that, but all you need to take note of is the constant REDACTED FOR PRIVACY particualarly for the name and address. In this case Squarespace is redacting my name for privacy reasons, which you can do on .org.\
This is all I needed to submit to register a .org. There was no special certification, there was no are you who you say you are, nothing.
This domain costs me $20AUD a year and I can put what ever website and I registered it a few years ago on Google Domains.
A few examples of other .org websites:
- <ShortLinksHover LN="Archive Of Our Own (archiveofourown.org/)" LD="https://archiveofourown.org/" PageColour={PageColour} Title="Home | Archive of Our Own" Content="An Archive of Our Own, a project of the Organization for Transformative Works"/> A Fan Fiction Website, It has a reputation for having lots of sexual content on it.
- the 23 results on <ShortLinksHover LN="Wikipedia's List of fake news websites" LD="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites" PageColour={PageColour} Title="List of fake news websites" Content="Wikipedia"/>

## So where did this come from?
The origins of this myth was based in truth, in 1985 .org was "intended as the miscellaneous TLD for organizations that didn't fit anywhere else" and required some form of verification, but in 2009 the administrator for .org announced .that .org would be the first open gTLD.
That was 16 years ago and this myth is still around.
\
Funnily enough .au requires that the registrant have their full name publicly and their email address behind a captcha on the auDA website, so in theory it\'smore trustworthy. But wait why do I know that...

# I am moving domains

### But dynamitegus where are you going?
dynamitegus.au and dynamitegus.online for a year
### but why dynamitegus.org is funny
I know it\'san open gTLD now, but I dont feel comfortable being on a .org when I\'m not an organisation and I\'m just a goob. So hopefully over the next couple of months I\'m going to move to dynamitegus.au

## Quick story
When I looking for a new domain I realise that .au required public details of the registrant, this concerned me and I then dug through four registrar FAQ and support pages to find that the fourth registrar was the only one to say that it was only the full name and the email and the email is only on the .au whois website. and that was the one thing that earned them my purchase. When I signed not only did I get a 50% off discount but I also got dynamitegus.online for free and by defualt dynamitegus.online was set to not autorenew. It\;s the little things that make a customer want to stay with you for life and I\'m very happy with where I ended up.'
If your website currently does not have a domain and you need a new one, I recommend VentraIP

# In Conlusion and TLDR
- .org is not trustworthy
- dynamitegus.org will soon become dynamitegus.au.

Thanks for reading this very long blog post, I\'m now gonna gonna quickly fix some typos and push this to github, then I might go to bed,
