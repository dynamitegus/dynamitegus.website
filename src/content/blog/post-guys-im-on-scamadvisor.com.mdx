just realised dyanmitegus.online is never explained in this article,\
when i registered for dynamitegus.au ventraip gave me a free domain for a year, that domain is dynamitegus.online. ATM it is nothing special its just a excact copy of dynamitegus.au
# so someone put me on scamadviser.com
and by me i mean dynamitegus.online\
so yeah when you look up dynamitegus on google and you make sure it knows that you meant dynamitegus and not dynamites, scamadviser.com is the 6<sup>th</sup> result or smth. This is the great and it makes me happy.\
anyway here photo:

i dunno why, i think it might be because it uses a .online which they may just monitor and scann all of them or something but im not really sure and they dont say anything about it on their website FAQ.
also it seems like scam advisor isnt a great website see <ShortLinksHover LD="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1flfrwy/precautions_using_scamadviser/" LN="this reddit post on r/CryptoScams" Title="Precautions using Scamadviser : r/CryptoScams"  Content="When using Scamadviser to verify the validity of a website to determine if it is a scam, beware of the results." PageColour={ PageColour } /> and <ShortLinksHover LD="https://www.reddit.com/r/TechSEO/comments/1kh3q6p/scamadviser_is_damaging_seo_for_honest_websites/" LN="this reddit post in r/TechSEO" Title="ScamAdviser is damaging SEO for honest websites — here’s how : r/TechSEO" Content="ScamAdviser claims to fight online scams, but in reality, it's one of the biggest frauds on the web. Here's how it works." PageColour={ PageColour }/>. Yeah this site seems pretty garbage, and alot like a scam if that last post is to be believed. Honestly IMO this reddit post is a little suspect only because of how had the OP goes after these guys, like yeah its a problem but it doesnt seem like it deserves this much attack, idk maybe its because it doesnt effect me as much as it does OP, and it doesnt seem to be like OP is making it up as there are multiple other accounts that I have not dug into because I just cant be bothered and it seems like alot to type out to just talk to yourself <ShortLinksHover LD="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWEgD1PVFNg" LN="but weirder things have happened on the internet" Title="The 'Author' of My Immortal Emailed Me, And Then It Got Worse - Sarah Z" Content="In which I solve a decade-old My Immortal-related mystery... but probably not the one you're thinking of." PageColour={PageColour}/>.
But yeah if that reddit post is to be believed then they just have an indexing service that goes through domain names.
