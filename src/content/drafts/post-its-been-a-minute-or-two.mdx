export const PageColour = "text-peach"
import ShortLinksHover from '/src/components/ShortLinksHover.astro';

I geuss I should start from <ShortLinksHover PageColour={PageColour} LD="./post-whata-ive-been-doing.md" LN="the first in this Series" Title="What I've been doing" Content="What I have been doing on my website over the past month or two."/>.
but thats alot of effort as I would have to look through my commits and I dont really want to do that right now, so instead I\'m going to pick my favourites atleast until I can be bothered.
## My favourites
- The <ShortLinksHover PageColour={PageColour} LD="" LN="Hovercard" Title="Hover Card" Content="Woah Much Hover"/>
