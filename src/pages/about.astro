    Hi, I am DynamiteGus, a goofy goober from a little place called earth. You
    may of heard of it.<br />
    I am a budding Programmer that doesnt really know what they are doing, who mainly
    dabbles in Javascript(and HTML + CSS), Rust and what ever Arduino Lang is(C/C++
    i think). I am interested in computers and other electronics, if you couldnt
    tell and i love finding old tech in op shops<br />
    I play a lot of Minecraft, Honkai Star Rail and Phasmophobia among other games,
    and I use Fedora 41 or whatever the latest version is on my laptop and pc. My
    Current laptop is a Framework 13, Speced with a AMD Ryzen 7 7840U, the 2.8K Display
    and the big battery.<br />

    <i>what else does this need, pronouns and that sort??</i><br />
    If you really care, I dont mind what pronouns you use as long as they are either
    he/him, she/her or they/them.<br />
    Also if you care my sexuality is not relevant because I am not looking for a
    relationship, but if you must know it is keiraisawesomexual.
